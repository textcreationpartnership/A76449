            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This town was for a long time accounted the forlorn hope on both ſides, upon the ſucceſſe of which each built their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall iſſues, As often were we buried in the feare of our friends, as in the boaſts of the Rebels.

            <p>In the midſt of theſe diſtractions, whereas others with good cauſe were deſerted of their Paſtors, I was deſerted of my Congregation: moſt of the better ſort fled to Sea, and with very affectionate expreſſions entreated me to the like, preſuming by the barbarous cruell uſage of others of the Clergie my danger to exceed theirs, thoſe who could not flie came about mee for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; I was ſoon reſolved (as indeed never admitting any other inclination) not to leave them in their miſery, but to live and die with them, remembring that of our Saviour, that the Shepherd ſhould hazard <hi>his life for his ſheep,</hi> as that of Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> to <hi>Iuſtina</hi> the Empreſſe when he was commanded either to receive the <hi>Arrians,</hi> or to leave <hi>Millain</hi> anſwered, <hi>Non prodam lupis gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem mihi commiſſum hic occide, ſi libet,</hi>

No Barques left in the harbour to remove them, the beſt courſe which the miſery and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of that time would afford was not neglected, but none could promiſe ſafety.

But it was ſo reſented, that howſoever the Town Armes offered their ſervice that night, yet it was rejected, and notwithſtanding the wet, long, and heavy march that day, three hundred of the Souldiers were drawn out of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Companies to continue the Watch that night, wherein our vigilant Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour took a voluntary ſhare himſelfe alſo.</p>

Before this Regiment came to us, at the earneſt requeſt of the ſaid Sheriffe of <hi>Louth,</hi> the State was
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:111012:17"/> ſo farre moved as to ſend down three hundred Arms, for the defence of that County (who had not then declared themſelves) with about fourty more for the Guard of <hi>Dundalke,</hi> but the ſuſpition of their treachery ſenting ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger here then poſſibly it might 20 miles further were by my Lord <hi>Moore</hi> ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in their paſſage.

               <p>The Parliament time now drawing on, my Lord <hi>Moore</hi> was neceſſitated to a ſecond journey to <hi>Dublin,</hi> where as he was not backward in a free and full declaring himſelfe againſt ſome Excuſers of this Rebellion, ſo was he not unmindfull of this Towne, and Countrey adjoyning; But propounded a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond motion, exceeding the former, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſeeing Sir <hi>Henry Tichburnes</hi> Regiment conſiſting but of one thouſand Foot, and one hundred Horſe, was not of that number and ſtrength, as to ſecure the Towne, and to iſſue farre out for the prevention of any further approach of the Enemy; <hi>Hee offered to raiſe ſixe hundred men more at his owne charges, to cloath them and give them pay till a ſupply of moneys ſhould be ſent out of</hi> England, <hi>conditionally that the foure Compantes in the Towne over and above the former, and not yet affixed to any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment might be added to his Command to make up a thouſand.</hi> By which <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalke, Atherdee,</hi> and the whole County of <hi>Louth</hi> might poſſibly have beene ſecured. But it was not ſo readily accepted as it merited. Thus by this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and Noble offer, his affection to the cauſe being fully diſcovered, and being (as I have been enformed) the only Lord in the <hi>Pale</hi> (excepting the Earle of <hi>Kildare,</hi> and the Lord of <hi>Hoath)</hi> who was a Proteſtant, the malice of the Rebels was further inraged, and preſently tooke the advantage of his abſence, to draw up to his houſe of <hi>Mellifont,</hi> to the utter ſpoyling and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iaging of it, as will appeare by the Relation following, which diſaſter hee hath beene ſince aſſured by them, was the fruit of his former motions, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done the next day after his returne.</p>

               <p>UPon the one and twentieth of <hi>Novemb.</hi> being Sunday, as we were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Church in the morning, there came a rumour to our Governour of the Rebels intention to beſet <hi>Mellifont,</hi> about three miles from us; Whereupon he preſently was ſending o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t to the former ſtrength there a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſupply of two hundred Foot, and a troope of Horſe; But as the Drums were beating, there marched downe the hill of <hi>Tallihaſcot,</hi> about two miles from us Northward a thouſand men, (as they ſeemed) giving many ſhot as they came; This gave a ſtop to the iſſuing out of the former forces, as inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting by that and other Circumſtances their aime was rather to ſurpriſe the Towne, but by the iſſue it appeared the plot was only to divert us, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at that ſame inſtant about Fifteene hundred from other parts drawing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Mellifont.</hi> The force left there to defend it againſt ſome Pilferers, beſides a few ſervants of the houſe, was only twenty foure Muſquettiers, and fifteene Horſe, two Scouts they had abroad, one of whom was cut off, the other purſued to the very Gates; about an houre before their comming <hi>Mac-Maghon</hi> ſent a note (which I ſaw) to the <hi>Warders of the houſe</hi> (as hee ſtiled them) that if they would give it up, they ſhould have quarter, and withall a Bullet for a token.</p>
               <p>The quarter-maſter of the Troope returned a ſhort anſwer, they would all dye rather then yeeld, and a bold Scotch-man ſtanding by, bid the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to adviſe his Maſter to make his Bullets bigger. Many meſſengers were with all expedition diſpatched hither with letters fowed up in their cloathes, for the ſafer conveyance, but we heard not of them. All wayes being thus ſtopped, and finding no hope of any further reliefe, they prepared themſelves for their owne defence, for any promiſe of quarter, by the experience of their falſhoods to others they gave little credit to; They accounted themſelves but dead men, and ſo were reſolved to ſell their lives at as deare a rate as they could, ſhooke hands, and incouraged one another. The Enemies Horſe and Pike were placed upon the top of the hill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> amongſt whom is confeſſed were ſome, who not many dayes before profeſſed the quite contrary. Their Foote marched over the Garden ſides in multitudes, whom theſe few of ours ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that they fell all backe about fourty yards, and ſo accordingly retrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:111012:18"/> foure or five times; In briefe, they killed ſevenſcore of them, and had made them up ſo many hundreds, but for want of Powder, having at the moſt but Sixe ſhot, ſome but Foure; not a man of them was hurt till all was ſpent, they had cut their Bullets into halfes, and to make even with their Powder, they rammed in five or ſixe together, whereby each ſhot was the death of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and in concluſion when all was ſpent, they broke as many Muskets as they could againſt the walls. The Serjeant who had the command of the Foot behaved himſelfe very valiantly, by the Confeſſion of the Enemy, and at their entrance ſlue many with his Halbert. Halfe a dozen placed in a little outward Caſtle killed ſome of them, as they were marching downe the hill, amongſt whom was one of the chiefe Captaines, in rich ſtolne cloathes, at whoſe fall there was a great cry. Theſe at laſt being promiſed quarter, and yeelding, yet they wounded, and threw them out at the windowes.</p>
               <p>The Horſe who could doe but little good within, when they ſaw them preſſing ſo thicke to the very Gates, opened them, and gave them a deſperate Charge, and ſo made their way through them, though by their purſuers ſcattered divers wayes before they came hither. The number of the ſlaine in all of our ſide were thirteene (whom a Fryer (for none of our Clergie durſt venture thither) was ſo forward for a deed of Charity, as to procure them buriall in the Church adjoyning, and one man finding life in him (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding at leaſt fourty wounds) brought him home on a Carre; The courſe they tooke with him was the ſame they did with others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they firſt ſtript him, leſt he ſhould bloudy his cloathes, and then a dozen of them together run him through, and hacked him with their Skeenes, leaving him for dead. But the moſt barbarous act was the killing of a grave comely old Gentleman, of above foureſcore yeares of age, who after he had opened the Wine-ſeller, and was giving them all poſſible courteous entertainment, and filling wine to them, of a ſudden run him through. A poore old blind man that had beene the Porter (who could make no reſiſtance) they knockt downe; another as old as he they cut his throat, ſo inraged, that they ſlew the very dogs they found, broke the windowes, tooke up divers of the Plankes in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to ſeeke for moneys, ſearched the peoples mouthes for it, ript the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therbeds to take away the Tikes, carried away the Hangings, and other fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture that was portable, cut in peeces all the Coverings of the Chaires and Stooles, (many of which were very rich) broke with their Clubs a Cloſet of Glaſſes, and Gallipots full of ſuch Ingredients as they were incapable of, tooke away abundance of proviſion in the houſe, of Cattell and Horſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and what they could not carry they deſtroyed, to the loſſe of my Lord

The faire Haggard of Corne they thraſhed and tooke away afterwards by leaſure; The Women they ſtripped all ſtarke naked; The Chappell they made their quaſſing roome, broke the Pulpit, and all the ſeates, threw a faire Church Bible into the Mill-Pond, broke the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Bell; Their beſt language to them all was Engliſh dogs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whoores and Rogues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Heretiques, and the like.</p>

               <p>After this they yet deſiſted not to multiply their parleys daily, and in regard my Lord <hi>Moore</hi> was one of the Lords authoriſed by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to treat with them, they more thick than before applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to him, renuing ſtill their former proteſtations of love to him and his, wiſhed him to leave the Towne for his owne ſafetie, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their former honourable offer to make him their Generall, that full ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction ſhould be given him for his loſſes at <hi>Mellifont,</hi> (though I beleeve many of their eſtates could ſcarce have compaſſed it.) And to cleere them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of that hatefull aſpertion of Rebellion aſſured him to ſhow that good warrant for what they did, which ſhould give all the world ſatisfaction, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned him very earneſtly for a meeting. The place and time agreed upon his Lordſhip with ſome few adventured out of the Gates, but in ſtead of them found ſome ſtragling fellowes gathering, which gave him juſt cauſe to ſuſpect ſome treachery, and ſo retreated, (which ſince he hath been aſſured of.) Yet that night they came to the Gates to excuſe it, and upon promiſe of ſaftie entered, but neither ſpake nor ſhewed any thing to the purpoſe, ſtill confirming our opinions of them to be <hi>falſe accuſers,</hi> and <hi>ſpeakers evill of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:111012:19"/> 
                  <hi>utterers of great ſwelling words of vanitie,</hi> and Inventors <hi>of lyes in hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie,</hi> according to which wee ever found their continuance. And yet to put an end to thoſe ſhadowy pretences, a motion was made of ceſſation of Armes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> till a Meſſenger were ſent from each withall expedition into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and ſo to procced according to the return of the Kings pleaſure, but they could not heare of that eare neither, though ſome anſwered they had ſent one of their own already for the ſame end, which yet wee weighed in as light a belief as the other.</p>
               <p>Some ſcattered ſpeeches have I heard fall from them, ſcarce worth the gathering up, they talked a little confuſedly of the Kings Prerogative, of an Act paſſing in <hi>England,</hi> that every Papiſt ſhould be preſently hanged, That they would have the Lord Deputy be always of the Iriſh birth, of their former heavy preſſures, freedome of their Religion and the like, the later of which they very preſumptuouſly and confidently avouched.</p>
               <p>Often have I heard them acknowledge (which wee knew very well our ſelves) that many of the Prieſts and Priers have been the chiefe movers of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Our Alderman Captaine ſayed a Fryer lately came from <hi>Spaine,</hi> threatned him, if he did not readily joyne with them, hee ſhould preſently have his head ſtruck off and hanged behind him, whom yet, wee knew, needed no ſuch ſpur to put him forward.

               <p>The Captains preſently began to draw up their men into a Battalia, and entred the field, The Souldiers ſeemed at firſt to be over-joyed to meete them, The Rebels making a ſtand, they did ſo alſo, But it ſo fell out as they were ready to give fire, one of the Officers (who dying in the place pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the like puniſhment for it) commanded a Counter-march, in which they being compelled to take a Ditch were diſordered, and the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my judging it a flight gave ſuch a ſhout that frighted them into a further confuſion, and ſo preſently charging them were routed, moſt were ſlaine, many eſcaped hither with their Armes but more without, <hi>two of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains were killed,</hi> the other eſcaped with one Enſigne.

The cauſes of this diſaſter are diverſly pleaded by the Souldiers and Commanders, which I will not take upon mee to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>
               <p>This accident was our greateſt loſſe, and our Enemies gaine, by the large portion of powder, match, armes, and moneys, which were made a prey of, yet ſome good was produced out of this evill, being the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <p>Aſſoon as the Scout that morning brought us the news of the Enemies marching that way, our valiant Governour made out preſently with ſix hundred foot and two troops of horſe, but before he could reach the place, the Rebels were fled with the carriages, as being the mayne thing they ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at, but that falſhood of our Neighbours on the Northſide of us appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red evidently, two of their Commiſſioners (the Sheriff and our Alderman) were at that inſtant in parley with us, from them, and as ſoone as the certainty of the ill news came, joy might be diſcerned in their ſmiles, who, by much of their diſcourſe to me that morning, it was cleere they were of the Plot: feares they preſently multiplyed upon ſuch as were apt for them, what bloudy fellows they were, and deſperate, giving alſo an aſſurance of a proſecution that night and the like, which in reaſon being probable enough, the whole Regiment ſtood to their Armes, and were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed their ſeverall Guards upon the firſt Alarme, but they had not th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Not long after this, the Rebels took the opportunity of another advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage alſo in the ſurprizall of a <hi>Cheſter</hi> Barke at the <hi>Skerries</hi> whoſe owner upon great preſumptions is believed to have beene corrupted to it by three or foure of our Popiſh Merchants aboard her, who againſt the deſire of the reſt of the Engliſh (which was to have been for <hi>Dublin,</hi> or any other Port) would put in no where but there, and ran her aground alſo, which in regard of the open Harbour, and the fairneſſe of the weather it could not be but a voluntary act. And it further appeared by the mirth of the Merchants as ſoone as ſhe was ſtuck, their preſent violent rifling the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh who had ſome good ſummes of moneys, before any Boat came out from the Rebels, That Barke was fraught with ſome extraordinary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of Powder and Ammunition for them, amongſt which there was a Harquebuſh made of purpoſe at <hi>Cheſter,</hi> at the charge and direction of one of our Town, The Papiſts in her, were welcomed by the kind greeting of the Rebels but the poore Proteſtant Engliſh robd of all they had, their Letters out of <hi>England</hi> intercepted and detained. As ſoone as they were landed deſiring a ſafe conduct hither, the Lord <hi>Netherfield</hi> out of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of favour would not ſuffer them, but ſent them to <hi>Dublin,</hi> aſſuring them he would not fail to take this Town within two days, and then they

So ſure did a ſimple Alderman of ours, who was with them expect it, that to mediate for the ſaving of one of their lives, and giving him a ſhilling to carry him to <hi>Dublin,</hi> he compelled the poore man to make over his houſe and what elſe hee had here, thinking to have taken poſſeſſion of it inſtantly, in due forme of Law. Nay, their boaſts then were to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. That they might eaſily ſee the cauſe was of God, it had ſo proſpered; that Gods ſpeciall hand was in it in ſo ſudden giving up the Kingdom into the hands of the Catholicks. Which ſince by the contrary event on our ſide, hath been retorted unto them otherwiſe, in our wonderfull delivery from them.</p>
               <p>Now were wee fully beſieged on all ſides, blockt up aſwell by Sea as Land, all ways of entercourſe towards <hi>Dublin</hi> ſtopped, Sentinels placed ſo thick night and day, that none could paſſe unſearched: divers wayes were daily tryed for the ſafe conveyance of Let<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This proved it high time to adde what elſe could be effected for our ſtrengthening the Town. Breſtworks were made before every Gate, Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms in ſuch places where the walls were defective, ſome for Sentinels to ſtand on, others for peeces to play upon, abundance of Morning-ſtars (as they call them) terrible weapons upon a wall, a world of Creſcets; to give light in a dark night round about the Towne, an Iron chaine croſſed the River, and which had beene our chiefeſt improvidence) a command to all neer hand to draw in their corn and hay, but was prevented by the Rebels, who about one a clock at night before that reſolution, fired at leaſt a thouſand pounds worth of ſeverall corne at once, a horrid ſight by the grain deſtroyed, horrible by the ſeaſon, but more lamentable as being loſt by the negligence and meere dulneſſe of the Owners, who had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to reduce it, and accordingly all helps offered them for the ſame end, before. By this act which redounded to the loſſe of the whole Town, might eaſily be interpreted their intentions, for the prevention of which (though a little too late) the Souldiers adventured our at ſeverall Ports, and brought in the reſidue that had eſcaped them. And by their example

In the midſt of this confuſion our men being amazed, our reſolute Governour (who muſt have the honour of that days ſervice) preſently light off his Horſe, and led the Foot himſelfe by the equal hazard of whom all were revived and encouraged, Commanded the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketiers up the Hill, and the Pikes in that narrow paſſage of the lane to open for the Horſe, and ſo with all expedition made ready.</p>
               <p>The Rebels by this had charged us twice, yet hurt not a man, but aſſoon as our Horſe and Foot came up, they gave them at once ſo full and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory an anſwer that without any further reply, they gave up the field and ſo betook themſelves to their heels, their cryes being now of another time, and ſo in our ſight from the walls were they chaſed a mile, or two, (the ſudden breaking up of the miſt being their farther diſcovery) to the loſſe of above two hundred of them, but not one man of ours. The Horſe who in this caſe muſt needs doe the chief ſervice, were by the ditches com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to divide themſelves, and each tooke a ſeverall path, according as the ſcattered rout led them.

At his ſudden unexpected approach the Governour made him ſenſible of his errour, which (being out of his element) he had runne into, that being come in without any Obligation from him, hee was at his mercy, whether hee would diſmiſſe him or no, yet notwithſtanding was pleaſed to paſſe it by only as an inconſiderate act, and not taking that advantage which the Law of Armes would juſtifie, granted him audience, and aſſurance of ſafetie, as if he had had it more formally under his hand, as it was both conditioned and preparing, and the Drum that came with him was as inordinate as himſelfe, being one of our owne Souldiers, not long before run away from us, whoſe doome by right was to have bin hanged.</p>
               <p>The ſumme of his demand was, <hi>The abſolute ſurrender of the Towne for his Majeſties uſe and ſervice,</hi> aſſuring us of ſuch deepe projects and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty forces, that it would be impoſſible (not expreſly excepting Gods pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er it ſelfe) ever to be relieved either by Land or Sea,</p>
               <p>The Governour with the Captaines anſwer, was as ſhort; that they had a Commiſſion from his Majeſtie bearing ſuch a date for the defence of this Towne againſt them, but could they produce a Countermand of a Later date, either from his Majeſty, or the Lords Juſtices for to give it up, they were ready to obey; In the meane time they thought themſelves more able to keepe it, then the Countrey was to keepe them. That as yet they had been put to no ſuch diſtreſſe, as to admit of any ſuch meane

               <p>Having this anſwer, the Fryer was as weary of his ſtay in Towne, as he was haſty of entring, only gave us a <hi>Copie of the Oath,</hi> lately taken by the Lords of the <hi>Pale,</hi> and (as he ſaid) by the reſt of the <hi>Pretended Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques</hi> neere us, which the next day it came to my hands, I thought it not unfit to returne it with the intereſt of a ſhort gloſſe, and a diſſwaſive appendix to the taking of it.</p>

               <p>The whole Garriſon of Foot and Horſe, conſiſting of eighteene hundred, ſtood to their Arms all that night, every Company being appointed to their ſeverall Guards, unto which there was added another of Volunteers out of the able and ſufficient houſholders of the Towne, to the number of fourſcore, who proffered themſelves, and had preſently a Captaine and Officers appointed them of whom ſeven were of the Clergie, all ſorts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception thinking it high time now to ſtand for their lives.

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:111012:25"/> not to take notice of. Not long after at a watch-word given and about the hour prefixed, they all approched the wals, and according to their uſe gave ſuch a terrible ſhout round about the Towne, ſuch as I remember never to have heard the like. The end of it was believed either to ſcar and confound our forces, or to invite the Town to make good their promiſe: for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of which ſome were heard to cry out of their windows, that the Town was loſt but neither had their iſſue. That tumultuous cry at one gate was inſtantly ſo well anſwered by the dolefull Echo of a Cannon from the Mount, that we ſoon heard them quite of another tune, as being the ſlaughter of multitudes of them: for three or foure houres was this mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicall diſcord continued, till by the miſtake of the clock, the day breaking ſuddenly before they were aware they took themſelves to ſlight, and every one invited the other to all poſſible ſpeed, after whom (being now fully diſcovered) were poſted all ſorts of ſhot from all quarters, which cauſed many (who by turning their backs had no mind to ſee their own deaths) to drop by the way: ſome of them by their clothes and faire horſes were deemed Commanders, ſcaling Ladders were multiplyed in the rumour which came often to our eares before, but wee ſaw none now, neither was indeed the time come, for their uſe. The numbers of their ſlaine is not certaine, only ſuch as were ſent out that morning upon a view, found all the fields bedewed with bloud, here and there ſome limbes ſcattered from their bodies, many cart loads of their dead were ſeen driving away, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance left behind in ditches, which in their haſt they had forgotten, whoſe ſtolne clothes and linnes proved a better booty to their ſtrippers then was expected, many being the very provant Clothes taken from ours at the Bridge, as with one of them (whoſe head was brought in) was found the very armour of one of our Officers ſlain there.</p>

Thus this night made choice of according to their proverb, in hope or Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> his bleſſing turned the contrary, much of their bloud was ſpilt, and by Gods eſpeciall goodnes none of ours, which that morning as ſoon as the ſtorm was over; we failed not in the Church ſolemnly and publickly to acknowledge, and to give him the praiſe to whom it is only due.</p>
               <p>This failing of the Town (who indeed were not at liberty to performe,) we heard moved the Rebels to vent many hard words againſt them, and till they received their excuſe, threatned to put no difference between them, and us, if ever they took it.</p>
               <p>Not many nights after when a revengfull reply was threatned again, &amp; by us expected there were found chalked upon moſt of the Papiſts doores white Croſſes to diſtinguiſh them from us; which ſome of ours perceiving they went up, and down; and privatly wiped them out, of purpoſe to guide the Enemies hands righter then their intentions; if they had entred, and ſet up Gallowſes in their ſtead, &amp; put the white Croſſes upon the Proteſtants doores, and indeed they had much merited of the Rebels by the diſtinſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they continually made between ours and theirs in their uſage. If any of our Popiſh Souldiers (whoſe hearts were juſtly ſuſpected to be without the Gates) were ſick, they wanted neither for clothes, phyſick, or diet, no more then their own children, by the private charity of the Maſters of the houſes where they were billited: But if a Proteſtant chanced to be ſick they would not give him a bit of bread, nor afford him the leaſt courteſie to ſave his life.</p>
               <p>Their Axes, Spades and other neceſſaries, much wanting for Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and cutting down of trees neer the Gates which ſheltered the Rebels from the ſhot, they hid or denied the loan of them, till by ſearching they were found, and ſo violent taken.</p>
               <p>About this time was a grand Conſpiracy found out, an oath admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring by a Popiſh Captain of the Town forces to thoſe of his own Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and ſome of ours of the ſame profeſſion, for the ſeizing upon our Souldiers Arms, as they were aſleep in their ſeverall lodgings, and ſudden killing them either in their beds, or at their Guards. The ſuſpition of which Plot ſented the ſtronger by being revealed by a Papiſt, who ſaid hee was adviſed by a Frier to take what Oath ſhould be adminiſtred to him by the ſaid Captain, who upon it was preſently committed, and by the firſt ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping

               <p>Many of the Troopers, as the foot who were Papiſts were found ſome nights within doores when they ſhould have anſwered the Alarms which with other circumſtances confirmed our beliefe, they had beene tampered with that way.</p>
               <p>By this timely repulſe of this long threatned onſet, we were in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hope of having the quieter Chriſtmas, when the Moon began to favour us with her light. Many Feſtivals in which, we ſolemnly kept as days of Thankſgiving to God, for our many deliverances. When (with what due preparation by the aſſiſtance of the Chaplaine and others of my Brethren here could be gained) the whole Regiment received the Communion, who with the Town Inhabitants, and other ſtrangers, made up ſuch a conflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Communicants for two or three dayes, that for many yeeres there hath not been ſeen the like, to the envy and regrating of our Neighbours. By this a rumour was raiſed amongſt the Rebels, as if all our Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders with their Companies had taken the Sacrament never to give up the Town, which ſomewhat daunted them, and as wee heard moved them to the like indeed, in their ſuperſtitious binding one another, by the ſacred linke never to leave the ſiege till they had it. Nay, ſome had prefixed the very day, but the event according to their fond beliefe in that particular, proved a meer deluſion. On Chriſtmas Eve we had a care of preventing their then cuſtomary frequent meetings, leaſt under their pretence of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, or hearing ſo many <hi>Maſſes,</hi> ſome other fruit ſhould have iſſued from thoſe aſſemblies.</p>
               <p>On Chriſtmas day a Captaine of theirs ſending his ſervant with a ſmall wild preſent to my Lord <hi>Moore,</hi> in exchange for a pottle of Wine, theſe following pretended Motives were received, which I thought ſit to inſert as followeth.</p>

               <p>After this about the end of <hi>December</hi> was there a great Ice, ſo that our River of the <hi>Boyne</hi> was in a night or two ſo hard frozen, that it could ſcarſe be broken with Mallets; Horſes and men might ſafely paſſe over, which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſome advantage to thoſe of the Enemies quarters that lay below the Bridge, made ours alſo the more vigilant in their watch, and they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no information and invitation from hence to take the preſent oportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>

The women were examined, but had good cauſe to deny it. How diligent our ſouldiers were night and day in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:111012:27"/> preventing any ſuch ſurpriſall, by breaking the Ice, may eaſily be imagined, which they had no ſooner done but it thawed of its owne accord.</p>
               <p>Upon <hi>New-yeares</hi> day, about foure of the clocke in the morning, foure Companies and a troop of Horſe invited themſelves to a viſit of ſome of thoſe quarters North-ward; but the delay they had in opening the Port, which the late froſt had unexpectedly hardened, hindered much of their deſigne, only Captaine <hi>Martin</hi> with his Company, who gate over the wall with ropes, killed ſome 15. with a Sentinell, whereas if the reſt could have followed in time, they had multiplyed them near to as many hundreds, ſo ſecure were they of our not daring ſo much as to approach near them, we put them to flight, burnt that Village and another and ſo retreated.</p>

Armes, Cowes, and other booty, to the value of a hundred pound worth, burnt their lodgings, and after a purſuite of a mile or two by the horſe, retreated, which they did very ſlowly, of purpoſe to have invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted another Body of them, not far off, to a preſent revenge of their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes: But they had ſeene enough of their bloud for one morning, ſome made an overture, but as our men faced about, they turned their backs, whom a Drake of ours over-reached, to the dropping of ſome of them. In this skirmiſh, howſoever they wanted not ſhowers of ſhot from the other ſide of the River alſo, yet there was not a man of ours hurt, excepting one, who (againſt command) continuing pillaging after all the reſt were gone, was taken tardy, and received ſome wounds according to his deſert, but eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped with life.</p>
               <p>Accidentally many were ſlaine among our ſelves in the ſtreets, and more in the like hazard ſtrangely preſerved. A Corporall of a troop once upon a nights alarum, riding in haſte towards the water ſide, a Sentinell apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his intent (by his not anſwering what he was) to have made over the River to the Enemy, ſhot him quite through the back, of which he dyed: The next night another received his deaths wound by his next fellow as they fate on horſebacke One (being drunke) diſcharging his Musket killed a man and a woman not far from him. A woman in the twilight carrying a paile of water upon her head, a ſhot from the wals at randome ſtrucke through the very bottome, and hurt her not, the bullet being found in the water, divers caſually ſhot through the crowne of the Hat, Armes, Breaſt,

               <p>Now victuals began to be very ſcarſe, the beſt ſort were confined to one meale a day, the common ſouldiers food was altogether herrings and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and no bread at all with it. This put every one to a narrow ſearch through their quarters; what was found was put into a ſtore-houſe, that Corne that was ſtill in ſtacks, was threſhed out immediately: But yet by reaſon of the want of Mills (moſt of which were without the Towne) little Corne could be ground but by Quernes, too ſlow a proviſion for ſo many thouſands of ſouldiers and Inhabitants.

               <p>In the midſt of this extremity hearing nothing from the State (who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed now conceived our caſe to be too deſperate to be ſupplyed) our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour thought fit to trim up a ſmall veſſell, which being loaded with ſome ſmall Peeces, and manned with forty Musketeers, was reſolved to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture her through the Enemies ſhot, with a little Friggot attending her, who in the fight ſhould have ſlipped through to <hi>Dublin.</hi> When they were ready, the Towne ſtill declared their hearts in hiding the Pilots, ſo that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter much ſearch none could be found, till at length my Lord <hi>Moore</hi> was faine to threaten to ſend halfe a dozen of the Aldermen in them, who ſhould be placed ſo, that they ſhould be ſure to be ſhot firſt, and ſo accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly apprehended two or three of them, by this ſcare, they who before pleaded ignorance, in the ſpace of an houre became ſuch knowing men, that they found out foure or five of the chief, to redeeme themſelves; for Sailors, we were yet compelled to make Proclamation, that if ſuch as were deſired came not at ſuch an houre they ſhould be declared traytors, and their wives and children turned out of the Gates, and by this courſe we were preſently ſupplyed, notwithſtanding when we had them, little truſt could we repoſe in them being Papiſts, doubts we had of the ſafety of our little fleet alſo,

Teares were in moſt mens eyes for gladneſſe, all with one conſent in the very ſtreet acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging it to be Gods handy-worke, and the very fruit of our prayers, only many of the Towneſ-men ſeemed to be dejected, and at their firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance within the harbour, endeavoured to dancke our expectation, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating they might be ſome of the Enemies friends from <hi>Spaine</hi> or elſewhere, and that the ſhot was but a colour to blinde us till they were entred within our bowels. In this bleſſing the handy-worke of God hath been diſcerned in divers particulars, they had ſunke a Barque in the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell, but a great freſh with a ſtrong Weſt wind had not long before thrown her out to Sea, they had two Barques on each ſide, by which they had with other Boates as ſupporters, fixed an Iron chaine with a Cable, croſſe the Channell, but it proved no let to their paſſage over, without ſo much as touching it. The Pinnace had put in by the way at <hi>Skirries,</hi> about twelve miles off, and burnt the Enemies lodgings, with all their Corne, and what was fit for booty they carried aboard. Now that which was obſerved as a ſpeciall Providence by the very Papiſts, was, that in one tyde they ſhould come from thence quite up to our Key, without ſo much as caſting Anckor

And it paſſed not without ſome notice, that this reliefe ſhould come upon one of our Church-dayes, when no ſooner Sermon was done, and we departed, where we had been begging that bleſſing, but every one was welcommed home with the newes of it. The very delayes of our two little veſſels (though againſt our minds) was a bleſſing, who if they had gone out, had run an iminent hazard by the Enemy, whoſe ſurpriſall muſt have been their great advantage. Thus winde and tyde, and all things wrought for our good, for which as we gave God thanks in his owne houſe, ſo outward tokens of joy were not omitted that Evening in the ſtreets, by bon-fires, vollies of ſhot, ringing of Bels, and the like.

And (if we may give credence to a Letter which I have ſeen of their owne (who uſually in theſe relations, ſhoot rather ſhort then over) ſome of the beſt of their Captaines were ſlaine, hurt, and lamed.

The Captaine who had then the command of the Mount miſtooke one of our Companies for the Rebels, who (by their making haſte up to the Hill, being breathleſſe and ſpeechleſſe, in not anſwering what they were) was juſt giving fire to a peece of Ordnance upon them, had not one man being beſt winded, by a timely anſwer ſaved the reſt.</p>

But at length, ſeeing all going, and none returning, they judge it but to be but like beaſts to the Lyons dennes, and ſo that ſport was ended, and yet ſo ſtrong were they of that beliefe that they ſtill kept their

And yet for any of our priſoners returned at any time from the Rebels naked and ſtarved, not a crum of Charity could be wrung from them, were it to the preſent ſaving of their lives: Charity which in it ſelfe is ever commendable, yet with this diſtinction is miſtaken, and loſeth it's reputation, evidently declaring the hearts of the Doners.</p>
               <p>Often were we threatened with Alarums, men ſeeming to gather out towards Evening, as if there had beene ſome reality in it: Houſes near the Towne upon Hils were fired, which were their uſuall Signals for an union of forces on both ſides; but they proved but bravadoes, their only refuge we found now, was ſtarving us: As ſometimes they would approach ſo near us as to aske our Centinels if they had yet eaten their Cabbage-ſtalkes, or wanted Horſe-fleſh.

               <p>The Towne was put to a narrow Scruteny, Sellers were ſearched with ſpits, as well as lofts, in each of which, much proviſion was found againſt the oathes of the owners. In the Fryeries, againſt their vow of poverty, were found Trunkes of Plate and Money, with other Treaſure, which howſoever they owned them not; yet being the goods of Rebels, it was their little praiſe to be the receptacles of them.</p>

               <p> In this extremity ſome mutinies were broached among the ſouldiers, but wiſely ſtopped againe: The very Engliſh as well as the Iriſh for want ſled to the enemy.

               <p>Our expectation of reliefe by Sea ſtill failed us, ſo that we were compelled to man out a little Friggot our ſelves to <hi>Dublin,</hi> with ſome Commiſſioners to relate our miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which we feared they were not ſenſible of, and after much inconſtancy of windes in driving her often in and out, at length, <hi>February</hi> the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. ſhe went to Sea, paſſing the Barr without any prejudice by the Enemies, only they honoured us ſo farre as to beſtow two Peeces of Ordnance upon her for a farwell, but touched her not, and yet in two ſeverall places they were planted ſo near the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell (as we now finde their works) that one would thinke it were a wonder ever to miſſe.</p>

               <p>The next morning, it was thought neceſſary to proſecute this unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected victory as a probability of raiſing the Siege, ſo they were taken before they could gather to any head againe, which howſoever being Sunday, our Religious Governour was very ſlow to it, as deſirous ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to have ſpent that as a day of thankeſgiving to God, for the good ſucceſſe of this day, yet being for the neceſſary preſervation of the Corne, and other things, which they had reaſon to ſuſpect would elſe be inſtantly fired by them, he conſented to it, and ſo very earely by breake of day 600. foote, and 120. Horſe, under my Lord <hi>Moores</hi> Command (after we had by Prayer commended them to Gods Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, (which in the like expedition was ſeldome omitted) marched out with carriages, and two field pieces. But the firſt Caſtle being within halfe a mile of us called <hi>Stanime,</hi> where there was a great hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of Corne, (which beyond their firſt reſolutions they thought fit to viſit by the way, and where they ſuppoſed there had not beene a man) they found ſo intrenched, and fortefied, that it proved more difficult then was expected, yet our men drew up boldly to them, within piſtoll ſhot, and though it was not the intent of that dayes worke, yet being provoked, beſtowed thouſands of bullets amongſt them, to the death of many of the Rebels in their Trenches, but by the ill ſhots of our Gunners (who ſtill miſſed the houſe) with the fall and continuance of abundance of raine, whereby their matches were waſhed out, they were compelled to retreate; and ſo came dropping wet home, yet by Church-time, to give God thankes for their great preſervation, who though continuing ſo long in that imminent danger (which they dreamed not of, at their going out) yet was there not a man loſt in the place, onely ſome of ſlight wounds by poyſoned bullets, and want of good medicines, miſcarryed a long time afterwards, and in the meane time, ſome were ſent to the next village of <hi>Colpe,</hi> where they loaded themſelves with their Corne, and returned, without any oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition: And not many dayes after upon the hearing of our prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a reply, the Rebels in the aforeſaid Caſtle of <hi>Stanime</hi> aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned

               <p>And here it hath beene reckoned as a thing very obſervable, that in all theſe onſets, invaſions, and Sallies out, (howſoever multitudes have dyed of the famine, divers unarmed pillagers met with abroad, have beene taken and butchered, ſome dyed of wounds by the unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of the Chirurgion, and the like) there hath not hitherto beene killed of armed men upon the place in fight (as I have beene enformed) above twelve of ours, and not one Officer; and of thoſe, there was but one man that was not fetcht off from them, and that is accounted the due of his too much preſumption, who at the aſſault of a houſe charged, and diſcharged his musket twice or thrice againſt the very doore, where there were many playing at him from within, and ſo ſtood as a marke for them, without ſo much as ſtirring a foote of his ground, but of the Rebels how many hundreds, if not thouſands, have beene killed, may eaſily be ſummed up in the reading. This won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull preſervation was I beleeve the occaſion of that falſe rumour rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by them, as if ſome of ours had ſold their Soules to the Devill to be ſhot-free, and yet at other times to encourage their Souldiers (who were continually upon their flight) they would upon moſt Sallies per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them of hundreds of ours ſlaine with many Commanders (of whom ſome had dyed often in their reports) when there was not one, nay ſcarce would they ſuffer them to beleeve their owne ſenſes, that any were killed of theirs: Howſoever, thoſe of the ſoberer ſort were much convinced of the cauſe, by the event, apparently ſeeing that God was with us.</p>
               <p>After one dayes reſt, <hi>March</hi> the firſt, my Lord <hi>Moore,</hi> and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour went out againe the ſame way, with a competent number of Horſe and Foote, when (after the ſecuring in of at leaſt two hundred pounds worth of Corne, by foure Companyes under the command of Sir <hi>John Borlace,</hi> and the burning of ſuch of their lodgings, as had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained of the former dayes work at <hi>Colpe,)</hi> they advanced further, their firſt reſiſtance was two Companies of the Rebels, ſtealing along the ſide of a Ditch, who being diſcovered Captaine <hi>Billinſley</hi> was ſent with 80. Musketteers, and comming as unexpectedly upon them, as they had entended upon us, were ſoone routed. A Lieutenant with thirteene Souldiers were ſlaine, and a Captaine of the <hi>O Neales</hi> taken priſoner; the reſt eſcaped into the Caſtle of <hi>Stanime</hi> by the helpe of a Bogge,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:111012:44"/> which ſtopped the horſe in their chaſe: the Caſtle of <hi>Colpe,</hi> after much hazard of ſuch as firſt entred it, by the Pikes and ſtones throwne of thoſe within, whereby they were three or foure times beaten downe the narrow ſtaires, at length was taken, where they killed them every one, to the number of twenty ſixe perſons; and yet neither then, nor all that day was one of ours loſt. With the Captain taken priſoner, wee found many Petitions, two Letters ſuperſcribed to Sir <hi>Phelemy O Neile,</hi> with the title of Earle of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> and Generall of <hi>Ireland:</hi> But yet the foundation upon which thoſe airy honours were built, was the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his taking this Towne, but that day his Excellency was much humbled (who unknowne to us) had ſtole over the river, onely with five men, and by our unexpected approach (being cut off from ſecuring himſelfe where he intended) crept into a furbuſh, and ſo lay like a trembling Hare in his Forme, till the evening, (where being ſo neare us) he had good lucke he was not ſtarted up by ſo many hunters, which needs muſt have beene the beſt ſport that day; Some rough abuſive greetings paſt and repaſt from each ſide the river, (which parted them from any other then ſuch a tongue combate) ours giving them lawfull warning of a viſit ſhortly, and that not by a cowardly creeping in the darke (according to their cuſtome) under our wals, but at noone day, when we might be viſible, asked for their drunken Generall, in deriſion of whom, ſome of our Trumpeters gave ſome ſcornefull muſicke, and for one Piſtoll of theirs, diſcharged in defiance, we returned them ten, and for one Muſquet, twenty, and thus our Souldiers in their retreat, ſtretching their throats to be heard with ſuch kinde of language, they made up a merry end of that dayes skirmiſh.</p>
               <p>Some Engliſh now, as at other times, tooke the opportunity to get from under their thraldome, and enformed us of ſome advantages, whom commonly they put in Trowſes to be taken for Iriſh, and in the front to be firſt killed, yet they uſually ſcaped, from theſe we underſtood by what lying practiſes they had kept their Souldiers from running away lately.</p>

               <p>By the ſight of this good ſucceſſe our Enemies grew ſicke of envy, and in a diſcontent left their houſes; yet in the midſt of this cheare, we had the feare of a rubbe, by the running aground of a Friggot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming up from the Pinace with Powder, but by being Maſters of the field on that ſide, we were not much troubled; the Rebels got into ſome Boats, and played thick upon her, whom ours replyed to as faſt, many ſhot they made with a great braſſe piece, but ſtill miſſed her, at length the Pinace gave ſo fortunate a one, that it diſmounted theirs of its carriage, and at laſt when they found little fruit by their gunnes, they aſſaulted us with their tongues, a company of them approaching neare the River ſide, called ours Rogues and Traytors, their anſwer given them, was by a few Muſqueteers, who under the covert of ſome fires diſcharging, put ſome of them to a <hi>non-plus,</hi> and the reſt to their heeles; And ſo our men being then abroad, continued there for the ſecuring her till the next tyde at tenne aclocke at night, when they left her afloate againe; And yet alſo to divert their thoughts that way, our Governour cauſed ſome Muſqueteers about midnight to fally out on the other ſide, and gave two or three vollies of ſhot, which raiſed them through their quarters to ſtand upon their owne defence, and ſo the next tyde that danger was over.</p>

Rory,</hi> Mr. <hi>Art,</hi> Mr. <hi>Roſſe,</hi> Mr. <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hon,</hi> and one Colours; which had beene but the earneſt of many more, had they not (as ſome were ſeene) ſlipped them off their ſtaffes, and put them into their breeches, one <hi>Art Roe,</hi> Mr. <hi>Patricke,</hi> Mr. <hi>Art Moyle, mac Maghon,</hi> of great repute among them, (lately created by them Lord Baron of <hi>Monaghan,</hi> and whoſe head is valued beyond its worth in the Proclamation) was taken Priſoner, who being ſore wounded to the loſſe of one of his eyes, and perceiving by the other his inevitable end approaching, politickly ſtripped himſelfe ſtark naked, and ſo lay as dead among the ſlaine, till afterwards upon a view by Lieutenant Colonell <hi>Byron,</hi> who caſually finding him with a Saint <hi>Francis</hi> girdle (which for good luck he ſtill kept about him) and deeming him by
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:111012:46"/> that to be a man of ſome quality, commanded one of his Souldiers to cut off his head; upon the affright of which, the Varlet rouz'd himſelfe, and was ſoone recovered of his ſpeech, who inſtantly declaring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and aſſuring that the ſaving of his life ſhould be the redemption of my Lady <hi>Blany</hi> and her children, he was preſerved, and accordingly, hath wrote effectually for that welcome exchange, but as yet we finde him not ſo valued by them, who (having thus long failed our expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) he is every day in the way of preferment to be hanged; And thus Saint <hi>Francis</hi> his Cord proved farre from being a Girdle of verity, which being given him for his preſervation, proved very falſely the ſole occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his deſtruction. A hundred Muſquets were taken, and Pikes co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the ground every where, which the purſued were willing to be eaſed of, for the quicker ſpeed; others ſecured themſelves by a Bogge near hand, who upon their gathering thicke were ſo roughly admoniſhed by a Drake from us, that they ſoone removed their ſtandings farther off.</p>
               <p>And in all this hot skirmiſh in ſight of our very wals wherein they made their moſt deſperate reſiſtance (ſuch was ſtill Gods goodneſſe to us) not a man of ours was ſo much as hurt by them, one of our Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers was ſhot in the foote, but it was by a Souldier of our owne, and the Bullet firſt paſſed through the head of one of the Rebels. And here I muſt not let paſſe one merry paſſage, they had brought with them out of the North, an old woodden Image, called <hi>Mac Kill Murragh, (i. e.</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Mary)</hi> by which it is very common amongſt the Iriſh to ſweare, this venerable block did they repoſe much confidence in, for the taking of this Towne, and when it came firſt amongſt them, it was received with acclamations of joy, like the <hi>Arke in the Camp of Iſrael,</hi> to ſave them from the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> &amp; for good luck, was this time at <hi>Tallagh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hallon;</hi> But as ſoone as this hot worke beganne, his Guardian tooke care with the firſt to poſt him away on horſe-backe, and in leaping a ditch, the horſe threw the fellow and <hi>Mac Kill Murragh</hi> in the dirt, that two others were faine to take him up upon their ſhoulders, and to trot with him (with the loſſe of ſome of his limnes) towards <hi>Dundalke,</hi> as I have been ſince told by one of their own profeſſion; our Governor in the meane time with ſome horſe and foote iſſued out toward <hi>Beauly</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke their Generall Sir <hi>Phelemy O Neile,</hi> (as ſuppoſing he had not yet left that lodging) burnt <hi>Newtowne</hi> under his noſe, and beate two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours (which was all that appeared) into the Caſtle, and returned the ſooner upon hearing that hot worke, with an intention (if neede
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:111012:46"/> were) to have relieved my Lord <hi>Moore,</hi> but by that time he had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched halfe way, the bright firing of three or foure Townes thereabouts gave ſufficient aſſurance of the victory, and ſo made a ſtand; At the firſt bluſh, comming that way he was miſapprehended to have beene Sir <hi>Phe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Souldiers had got their fill of all ſorts of pillage, and howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever (in that hot proſecution a mile or two about) they might be thought to have enough of that mornings worke, yet were they ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to have beene at it againe, that they ſued to their Captaines to let them meet him preſently, offering to throw all their ſpoyle downe to make an end with him at once, but upon a ſecond inquiry they were found to be their friends. In this my Lord <hi>Moore,</hi> by the acclamations of all men, behaved himſelfe very valiantly to the greater hazard of his perſon, then his Captaines were pleaſed with, was cut through the boote with the ſword of one whom (having newly diſcharged his Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtols) he had ſtruck under his horſe with a halfe Pike, the fore-part of his Saddle runne through by another, his horſe hurt, all ſpattered with the dirt, which the thick flying of the Bullets raiſed, but had no other hurt; In this deſperate fight, being once diſcerned, two hundred of the Rebels gathered, and made up towards him, onely crying out, This is my Lord <hi>Moore,</hi> when (the reſt of the horſe in ſeverall Diviſions, being upon a proſecution) he had but ſeven in his Company, yet he retreated not, but charged them, many were killed, the reſt ſcattered, and were ſtill leſſened by their purſuers.</p>

               <p>And thus as our worthy Governour on the Saturday before had the honour in the beginning of the raiſing of our Siege on the South-ſide by a retaliating ſlaughter of ſo many of them at the fatall Bridge, ſo were we all pleaſed that this next Saturday on the North-ſide, my Lord <hi>Moore</hi> (to whom we were beholding) as our firſt ſuccour at the riſing of theſe Commotions, and our chiefe continued ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The fruit of which beganne that very evening to appeare, when ſome of the Engliſh now eſcaping from them, came in and gave us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that the Caſtles of <hi>Beauly</hi> and <hi>Stanime</hi> on each ſide the river were deſerted by the holders, and Sir <hi>Phelemy</hi> with the reſt of that neſt being fledge, were flowne away with ſome field-pieces towards <hi>Dundalke,</hi> into each of which our Governour inſtantly ſent ſome Companies, who accordingly entered without the leaſt reſiſtance, rounded the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey the next morning, two or three miles as farre as <hi>Termonfecken,</hi> but found not a man, onely a world of Corne, which in that haſte they had not time to fire.</p>
               <p>By this our Towne was filled with proviſion, Ports beganne to open, our neighbours making ſute to be admitted to our Market, Caſtles neere hand voluntarily ſurrendred, the owners ſubmitting, and all good mens hearts rejoycing by this ſudden change, begunne and finiſhed in the compaſſe of a weeke; every ſtreet ringing with praiſes to God the Donor, to whom we failed not ſolemnly and publikely to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it often.</p>
               <p>After the Rebels (that had ſo long beſieged us) were thus routed, and ſome of the chiefeſt of their Caſtles neare, poſſeſſed by us, Letters, as well from Lords, as other of the Gentry, came thick in to us, of which, ſome receiving no anſwer, came and preſented themſelves to our mercy; in ſpeciall, one <hi>Bath,</hi> who about the middle of <hi>December</hi> had came in with his Iri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h Dart accompanied with the Sheriffe of the County of <hi>Louth,</hi> (both Commiſſioners from the Rebels) and very confidently and arrogantly demanded the ſurrender of this Towne, who at firſt was aſhamed to owne the knowledge of me by reaſon of ſome ſpeeches that had then paſſed betweene us, the event of which had proved beyond his beliefe or expectation. The Letters of the Lord <hi>Netherfield</hi> and the Lord of <hi>Slane,</hi> with divers others of the chiefe of the Countrey have I ſeene under their owne hands in a moſt humble ſute to my Lord <hi>Moore,</hi> to ſtand their friend, ſome proteſting their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, others pretending themſelves deluded by the Northerne Iriſh, and heavily curſing the firſt plotters of this buſineſſe, and yet we knew they curſed themſelves, and had enough under their owne hands, they
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:111012:47"/> little dreampt of, to ſteare us right enough in our Judgement of them.</p>
               <p>From others we had faigned Letters of the approach of two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of <hi>O Relyes</hi> men, one way, and of eighteene hundred of Sir <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemy O Neiles,</hi> another way, and each within five miles of us: But the uſe they had given us of their lyes, and the contradiction which the ſubmiſſion of their Chiefe gave to it, made the newes of no value with us, yet it produced that effect, that to prevent their dry lodgings, there iſſued out ſome competent force to <hi>Slane,</hi> burnt the Towne and the Country neare it, tooke the Caſtle and pillaged it, with which the Souldiers came loaden home. And not long after my Lord <hi>Moore,</hi> and the Governour made a Salley out another way, ſpent the greater part of the day in burning forty or fifty Villages, tooke one <hi>Barnewall</hi> of <hi>Rahasket,</hi> who was a Colonell among the Rebels, and a great Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyer from them hither, and had beene many yeares Deputy, <hi>Cuſtos Rotulorum</hi> of that County (as dangerous a fellow by his naturall parts, and other education as any they had,) His Caſtle (after a few ſhot, and ſeeing our men appearing in a full body) he yeelded, where was found ſo much of bread and other victuals, ready baked, that no doubt, he expected the returne of his former Gueſts, beſides foure hundred barrels of Malt, and abundance of all ſorts of Graine, his Cellers full of Wine and Beere, which the Souldiers Feaſted themſelves with, for a while; he with his two Prieſts, taken with him, were (with ſeven or eight Fryers more) cloyſtered in one priſon here, but ſince he is promoted to the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Darcy</hi> of <hi>Plattin</hi> (two of whoſe Sonnes were Captaines among the Rebels, who had the ſtrongeſt and faireſt Caſtle in the Country is fled, leaving his Wife and Family, with about fifty Musketteeres to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it: This, howſoever the firſt time it was denyed my Lord <hi>Moore,</hi> and the Governour (as it had beene before to my Lord of <hi>Ormond)</hi> who demanded the ſurrender of it in the Kings name, yet the ſecond time hearing of our pieces of battery approaching, gave it up upon Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and ſo we have a Garriſon there alſo, by which our Towne is ſecurely Flanked on both ſides the River.</p>
               <p>After this, by the eſcaping of many poore Engliſh from their ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, we had evident aſſurances of the treacherous meſſages, and plots of our Popiſh Inhabitants, for the betraying this Towne unto them, ſome who never were here before, could name us the men, deſcribe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:111012:48"/> agreeing with our former informations and ſuſpition, was a ſure te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony.</p>
               <p>How many Letters in the midſt of theſe forlorne hopes, have I yet ſeene of theirs in a vaine comforting themſelves, with an aſſurance (to uſe their owne words) that the Almighty would doubtleſſe favour their juſt and innocent cauſe, and their holy intentions. Another I have ſeene of <hi>O Relies</hi> to my Lord <hi>Moore,</hi> that he had no newes, but that powder was in making every where (to uſe his owne words) thankes be to God, and our good King, &amp;c. But we knew at the ſame time he was falne ſicke upon the newes of Sir <hi>Phelemies</hi> late routing at <hi>Tallagh-hallan.</hi>

               <p>To relate what a change preſently there was in this Towne, from that extremity of ſcarceneſſe and deerneſſe, to what a plenty and cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe things were come, would be incredible: egges, which during this Siege, one was a rich preſent, worthy of thankes from the chiefeſt, were now fifteene a penny; Hens, at two pence, milch Cowes at five ſhillings, Horſes, which before the Siege, were rated at three or foure pounds, ſold for twelve pence, nay commonly paſſed among friends for a quart of Beere; The fineſt Wheate in the Market for eight ſhillings a Barrell, Fiſh (to which we had beene altogether ſtrangers) multiplyed abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, though ſuch a glut in reaſon cannot be imagined to hold ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny moneths, by the burning ſo many thouſand barrels of Corne, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from us, which they could not bring in.</p>
               <p>Many bloody murthers were committed upon the Engliſh Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, in revenge of this late defeate. At <hi>Atherdee,</hi> they killed all that were remaining there; the next night neere <hi>Slane,</hi> an old Gentlewoman, with her Daughter, and Grandchilde, had their throates cut in their beds; in divers other places they drowned Men, Women, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>The Earle of <hi>Ormond</hi> (Lieutenant Generall) was now not farre from us with 3000. Foote, and 500. Horſe, burning the County of <hi>Meath,</hi> and on the eleventh of <hi>March,</hi> attended with divers Colonels and Captaines, did us the honour of a viſit, and dined herewith my Lord <hi>Moore,</hi> at <hi>Droghedah,</hi> who began to recover ſome competent ability, of giving ſuch a troope ſome entertainement. Many at the ſight of the weakeneſſe of our Wals fell into admiration of the poſſibility of our holding out ſo long againſt ſuch a multitude. His Lordſhips in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of being the raiſer of our Siege thus unexpectedly prevented,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:111012:48"/> (God giving that honour before his approach to the feeble ſtrength of the beſieged) yet was very zealous to take the faire opportunity now given him of the full routing of the Rebels ſo newly diſperſt, by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, quicke proſecution of them, before they could get any head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Which, by my Lord <hi>Moore,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Tichborne,</hi> our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours relation, finding very ſeaſonable, and of little difficulty, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Councell of Warre, <hi>viz.</hi> the Lord <hi>Moore,</hi> and our Governour, Sir <hi>Thomas Lucas,</hi> Sir <hi>Simon Harcourt,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Ferrald</hi> with others, Theſe upon mature deliberation, finding good grounds to conſent with his Lordſhip, and conceiving great hopes of a good and ſpeedy ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, even to the clearing of thoſe Northerne parts, wrote to the Lords Juſtices very earneſtly, to enlarge his Lordſhips Commiſſion, (which before was ſo ſtraitned, that in the literall ſenſe, it could ſcarce ſtand with a liberty of relieving us, if there had beene need, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing commanded not to paſſe over the River of the <hi>Boyne,</hi> beyond which the greater part of our Towne is ſeated) alledging many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to enforce it, preventing an Objection in the want of victuals, by a proviſion undertaken by my Lord <hi>Moore,</hi> from his owne Lands neere adjoyning. And indeed, ſuch a confidence was apprehended of prevailing in this motion, that our Governour had picked out tenne Companies of our beſt men, fitteſt for that ſervice, and my Lord of <hi>Ormond</hi> deſigned the like number of leſſe experienced Souldiers for our guard in their roome, my Lord <hi>Moore,</hi> (as the beſt guide in thoſe parts) and Lieutenant Colonell <hi>Weyneman</hi> choſen by the ſaid Councell of Warre to be Commanders of them, All were ready for their march, and appointed to meete his Lordſhip at <hi>Slane,</hi> five miles off.</p>
               <p>But the Lords Juſtices proving ſtill conſtant to their former injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and renewing a ſtricter command for his preſent retreate to <hi>Dublin,</hi> that deſigne (ſo deſired by our Governour as an aſſured meanes of an inſtant reducing the whole County of <hi>Louth)</hi> was put to a ſtand, and thereupon our ſcattered rebellious route, who before were in a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling fit, now tooke heart againe, and gathered at <hi>Atherdee</hi> and <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalke,</hi> whither (as we heard) daily poſted thouſands out of <hi>Meath</hi> and <hi>Louth,</hi> as to their ſafeſt receptacles, and preſumed, not long after, to threaten us with another viſit.</p>

By the ſight of our mens continued undauntedneſſe, with one conſent they ranne all away, upon which that Diviſion entred, and the Horſe purſued them a full gallop to the killing of many of them. But upon the turning towards the next Gate, ſeeing two or three Braſſe pieces planted, and five hundred more ready to receive them, they fairely retreated, But a Caſtle placed at the head of that out-ſtreete, manned with their beſt Muſqueteers, which ours minded not, and for feare of endangering their owne men (at whoſe heeles ours were) had yet ſtood dumbe, now in our returne played very hot upon us, whereby ten of ours were ſlaine, An Enſigne, one Sargeant, and one that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed the Colours for another, a Horſeman with anothers Horſe was killed alſo, Lieutenant <hi>Francis Moore,</hi> was ſhot upon the ſhoulder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece of his Armour, which from thence rebounded upon his head, broke the skinne, and ſo ſtucke within his haire, without doing him any further hurt, which if it had beene deadly, ſurely he that made she ſhot muſt have merited ſome extraordinary reward, for as we heard from themſelves, and by all others our priſoners comming from what Quarter ſoever, no mans name was ſo odious with them, and ſo deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maliced, and threatned, if he could have beene taken.</p>

                     <p>Indulgences granted to the ſacred graine of Saint <hi>Joan,</hi> being a name of the third order of our bleſſed Father Saint <hi>Frances,</hi> and was a moſt godly and vertuous Abbeſſe, you muſt make no ſmall account of them, for the Pope did grant very many Indulgences unto them, and to other graines, and medals; They containe the vertue of that graine carried by the Angel-keeper of Saint <hi>Joan</hi> unto Heaven, as hereafter you ſhall note by the teſtimony of our Saviour.</p>
                     <p>They have ſpeciall power againſt Devils, for they are forced to flie out of the bodies of men, and whoſoever carrieth the ſaid graine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him needs not to feare no evill. They containe a moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vertue againſt Wild-fire, againſt the tempeſt of the Sea, and againſt all manner of infirmities incident to the ſoule and the body of man, and eſpecially againſt the Feaver, Peſtilence, the Scabbe, the tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Devill, and of Hereſies, for they have the vertue of the <hi>Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Dei.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe enſuing Indulgences were granted to theſe bleſſed graines by our Saviour and our bleſſed Lady, by the interceſſion of Saint <hi>Joan,</hi> who did impart the ſame unto the reſt of her Siſters at the houre of her death; Firſt ſay one <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> and one <hi>Ave Maria,</hi> and you merit as many Indulgences as <hi>Rome</hi> affords that day. After your Confeſſion and Remiſſion, ſay tenne <hi>Pater noſters</hi> and tenne <hi>Ave Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias</hi> in remembrance of the moſt precious bloud of our Saviour; and you are as innocent from ſinne as when you came out of the Stone, <hi>(i. e.</hi> the Font) and if you ſay them for any ſoule in Purgatory, his ſinnes are forgiven him. Our holy Father, Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the third, and Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeventh, did grant unto the graine theſe Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences following. Say one <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> one <hi>Ave Maria, Anima Chri.</hi> and <hi>Sal.

                     <p>Confeſſe and Repent on the feaſt of the transfiguration of our Lord, and at Eaſter, and ſay <hi>Anima Chri.</hi> and you obtaine forgiveneſſe of all your unperformed oathes; ſay certaine prayers in the honour of the bleſſed Sacrament upon Chriſtmas day, our Lady

               <p>By the death of ſo many men about us, having their houſes, and all their proviſion either burnt or drawne hither, the dogges onely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving, are found very uſually (like that judgement upon <hi>Jeſabell,</hi> for the murther of <hi>Naboth)</hi> feeding upon their Maſters, which taſte of Mans fleſh, made it very dangerous for the Paſſengers in the rodes, who have beene often ſet upon by thoſe Maſtives, till we were as carefull to kill them alſo.</p>
